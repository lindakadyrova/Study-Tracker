      <h2>1. Active Recall</h2>
      <p>Active Recall is a proven learning technique that involves retrieving information from memory instead of passively re-reading. After learning something, close your book and try to write or say everything you remember. This forces your brain to strengthen neural pathways, improving long-term retention.</p>
      <p>Use flashcards, quizzes, or teaching someone else to reinforce this. It feels harder than reviewing, but that difficulty makes it so effective.</p>

      <h2>2. Spaced Repetition</h2>
      <p>Spaced Repetition spreads your reviews over increasing intervals: today, then in 3 days, then in a week. This method builds on the spacing effect—your brain remembers better when there's time between reviews.</p>
      <p>Use tools like Anki or Quizlet, which automate this by tracking your progress and optimizing the review timing. Ideal for vocab, formulas, or any memorization-heavy content.</p>

      <h2>3. Feynman Technique</h2>
      <p>This method, based on Richard Feynman’s approach, focuses on *deep understanding*. You pick a concept, try to explain it as if to a 10-year-old, then identify gaps in your understanding and fill them.</p>
      <p>Repeat until your explanation is clear and simple. This helps with complex topics in science, engineering, or anything that feels abstract or confusing.</p>

      <h2>4. Interleaving</h2>
      <p>Instead of studying one topic for an hour, mix related subjects—like geometry, algebra, and word problems. This forces your brain to switch contexts, helping you build connections and apply concepts flexibly.</p>
      <p>It feels more difficult, but research shows it leads to better long-term retention and performance, especially in math, science, and languages.</p>
